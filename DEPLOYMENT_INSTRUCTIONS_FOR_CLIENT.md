**Date**: February 5, 2026
**Developer**: Mr-S-26
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Deployment

---

## 🎯 What Was Done

Successfully migrated your video generation system from Shotstack to **Luma AI** for premium cinematic property videos.

### Key Improvements
- ✨ AI-generated cinematic camera movements (not just static slideshows)
- 🎬 Professional real estate video quality
- ⏱️ 15-30 second videos (5 seconds per clip)
- 📸 3-6 images required (optimized for quality)

### Quality Comparison
**Before (Shotstack)**: Static image slideshow with basic transitions
**After (Luma AI)**: AI-generated cinematic footage with dynamic camera movements

## 📋 What You Need to Deploy

### 1. Deploy New Edge Functions (Required)

You need to deploy 3 **new** edge functions and update 2 existing ones in your Supabase project.

#### How to Deploy via Supabase Dashboard:

1. **Go to Edge Functions**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/acpkhbjgnlenjfiswftx/functions

2. **Option A - Connect GitHub (Recommended)**:
   - Click "Connect to GitHub"
   - Select your repository: `ivanhtet28-maker/property-motion`
   - Supabase will auto-detect all functions in `supabase/functions/`
   - Click "Deploy All"
   - Done! ✅

3. **Option B - Manual Deployment**:
   If GitHub isn't connected, you'll need to create each function manually:

   **New Functions to Create:**
   - `generate-luma-batch` - Generates multiple Luma clips in parallel
   - `check-luma-batch` - Checks status of all Luma generations
   - `stitch-video` - Stitches clips with FFmpeg + overlays

   **Existing Functions to Update:**
   - `generate-video` - Complete rewrite for Luma workflow
   - `check-video-status` - New orchestration logic

### 2. Set API Secrets (Required)

You mentioned you already added `LUMA_API_KEY` - perfect! Verify it's set:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/acpkhbjgnlenjfiswftx/settings/functions
2. Check **Secrets** tab
3. You should see: `LUMA_API_KEY` (value will be hidden)

**Required Secret:**
- ✅ `LUMA_API_KEY` (you already have this)

**Optional Secrets** (for enhanced features):
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` - For voiceover narration
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For AI-generated property descriptions

### 3. Verify Storage Bucket

Make sure you have a `video-assets` bucket:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/acpkhbjgnlenjfiswftx/storage/buckets
2. Check if `video-assets` exists
3. If not, create it and make it **public**

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### Test Case 1: Basic Video Generation
1. Go to Create Video page
2. Upload **5 images** (or scrape a property URL)
3. Click "Generate Video"
4. Expected:
   - Takes ~3-4 minutes
   - Creates 25-second video (5 clips × 5 seconds)
   - Shows progress: "3/5 clips ready"
   - Final video has property details overlay

### Test Case 2: Minimum Images
1. Try uploading only **3 images**
2. Expected: Should work and create 15-second video

### Test Case 3: Maximum Images
1. Try uploading **6 images**
2. Expected: Should work and create 30-second video

### Test Case 4: Too Few Images
1. Try uploading only **2 images**
2. Expected: Error message "Add 1 more photo (3-6 images for 15-30s video)"

### Test Case 5: Too Many Images
1. Try uploading **7 images**
2. Expected: Error message "Maximum 6 photos allowed"

## ⚠️ Important Changes

### User-Facing Changes:
- **Image requirement**: Now 3-6 images (was 5-10)
- **Video duration**: 15-30 seconds (was 13-30 seconds)
- **Generation time**: 2-5 minutes (was 1-2 minutes) - longer but much higher quality
- **Cost per video**: ~$0.60-$1.20 (was ~$0.05) - premium quality justifies higher cost

### Technical Changes:
- Removed Shotstack API dependency
- All videos now use Luma AI for cinematic footage
- FFmpeg stitches clips with overlays
- Database tracks progress 0-100%

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code"

**Cause**: Edge functions not deployed yet

**Fix**:
1. Go to Supabase Edge Functions dashboard
2. Deploy all 5 functions (3 new + 2 updated)
3. Verify deployment successful

### Error: "LUMA_API_KEY not configured"

**Cause**: Secret not set or incorrect

**Fix**:
1. Go to Edge Functions → Secrets
2. Add `LUMA_API_KEY` with the key from your Luma Labs dashboard (never commit API keys to code or docs)

### Error: "All Luma generations failed"

**Possible causes**:
- Image URLs not publicly accessible
- Luma API rate limit exceeded
- Invalid image format

**Fix**: Check Luma dashboard at https://lumalabs.ai for API status

### Video generation taking too long

**Expected times**:
- 3 images: 2-3 minutes ✅
- 5 images: 3-4 minutes ✅
- 6 images: 4-5 minutes ✅

**If longer than 10 minutes**: Check edge function logs:
```
Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → Logs
```

## 📊 Cost Breakdown

### Per Video Cost:
- **3 images**: $0.60 (3 clips × $0.20)
- **5 images**: $1.00 (5 clips × $0.20) ← Recommended
- **6 images**: $1.20 (6 clips × $0.20)

### Monthly Estimates:
- 100 videos/month: ~$100
- 500 videos/month: ~$500

**Note**: Higher cost than Shotstack, but significantly better quality for premium listings.
